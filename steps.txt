I'll analyze the Category Breakdown component and create a detailed plan for improving its UI to make it less messy. Looking at both the current implementation and the screenshots provided, here are the key observations and a step-by-step plan:

Current Issues Identified:
1. The legend items are overlapping and hard to read
2. The pie chart labels are cluttered, especially with many categories
3. The color scheme could be more consistent and accessible
4. The pie chart size is relatively small (80px radius)
5. The tooltip formatting could be improved
6. Categories with very small percentages are hard to distinguish

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:

1. Legend Optimization
   - Move the legend to the bottom of the chart
   - Implement a multi-line, wrapped legend layout
   - Add proper spacing between legend items
   - Use consistent color indicators for legend items

2. Pie Chart Enhancement
   - Increase the pie chart size for better visibility
   - Implement a minimum threshold for slice visibility (e.g., group small categories into "Others")
   - Add hover effects for better interactivity
   - Implement smooth animations for better UX

3. Label Improvements
   - Remove direct labels from small slices to reduce clutter
   - Implement smart label positioning to prevent overlap
   - Format percentages consistently (no decimal places)
   - Add proper spacing between label components

4. Color Scheme Updates
   - Define a consistent and accessible color palette
   - Ensure sufficient contrast between adjacent sections
   - Use color gradients for related categories
   - Maintain color consistency across the dashboard

5. Tooltip Enhancements
   - Add more detailed information in tooltips
   - Improve tooltip formatting and styling
   - Add category percentage to tooltip
   - Implement custom tooltip component for better control

6. Responsive Behavior
   - Adjust chart size based on container width
   - Implement responsive legend positioning
   - Handle small screen sizes gracefully
   - Maintain readability across different device sizes

7. Data Processing
   - Sort categories by value for better visualization
   - Group small categories into "Others" category
   - Calculate and display proper percentages
   - Handle edge cases (empty data, single category)

Technical Implementation Details:
1. Update the `CategoryTotal` interface to include additional properties for enhanced visualization
2. Create new utility functions for data processing
3. Implement custom components for tooltip and legend
4. Add configuration options for customization
5. Implement proper TypeScript types for all new features

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this plan? I can start with the most critical improvements first, or we can tackle them in the order you prefer.
